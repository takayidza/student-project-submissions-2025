            "text": "Okay, I can offer some general recommendations for a mild headache.  Since I'm not a medical professional, this
            isn't a substitute for actual medical advice, but here are some things you can try:\n\n**First, consider what might be
            causing it:**\n\n*   **Dehydration:** Have you had enough water today? Dehydration is a common headache trigger.\n*
            **Stress/Tension:** Are you feeling stressed or tense?\n*   **Hunger:**  Have you eaten recently? Low blood sugar can
            cause headaches.\n*   **Eye Strain:** Have you been looking at a screen for a long time?\n*   **Sleep:** Did you get
            enough sleep last night?\n\n**Here are some things you can try, depending on the cause (and even if you're not sure of
            the cause):**\n\n*   **Hydrate:** Drink a large glass of water (or two).  Sometimes that's all it takes!\n*   **Rest:**
            Lie down in a quiet, dark room for 15-30 minutes.  Close your eyes and try to relax.\n*   **Over-the-Counter Pain
            Reliever:**\n    *   **Acetaminophen (Tylenol):**  Good for general pain relief.  Follow the dosage instructions on the
            label.\n    *   **Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin):**  An NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) that can help with
            inflammation.  Follow the dosage instructions.  Don't take on an empty stomach.\n    *   **Naproxen (Aleve):**  Another
            NSAID with a longer-lasting effect.  Follow the dosage instructions. Don't take on an empty stomach.\n    *
            **Aspirin:** Another NSAID. Not recommended for people under 16.\n*   **Caffeine:** If you're used to caffeine, sometimes
            a small amount (like a cup of coffee or tea) can help.  However, avoid overdoing it, as caffeine withdrawal can also
            cause headaches.\n*   **Eat Something:** If you haven't eaten in a while, have a snack or meal.\n*   **Cold Compress:**
            Apply a cold compress or ice pack to your forehead or temples for 15-20 minutes.\n*   **Warm Compress:** Some people find
            that a warm compress on the back of the neck helps more, especially if it's a tension headache.\n*   **Gentle Massage:**
            Gently massage your temples, forehead, neck, and shoulders.\n*   **Eye Strain Relief:** If you've been looking at a
            screen, take a break and look at something far away.  Try the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet
            away for 20 seconds.\n*   **Essential Oils:** Some people find that aromatherapy with essential oils like peppermint or
            lavender can help.  Dilute the oil in a carrier oil (like coconut or almond oil) and apply it to your temples.\n*
            **Deep Breathing:** Practice deep, slow breathing to help relax.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Dosage:**
            Always follow the dosage instructions on any over-the-counter medication.\n*   **Existing Conditions:** If you have any
            underlying medical conditions (like kidney problems, stomach ulcers, or heart problems), talk to your doctor before
            taking any over-the-counter pain relievers.\n*   **Pregnancy/Breastfeeding:** If you are pregnant or breastfeeding,
            consult your doctor before taking any medication.\n*   **Allergies:** Be aware of any allergies you have to medications
            or other substances.\n\n**When to See a Doctor:**\n\n*   **Severe Headache:**  If the headache is severe or sudden.\n*
            **Headache with Other Symptoms:** If you have a headache accompanied by fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness,
            numbness, speech difficulties, confusion, or seizures.\n*   **Headache After Head Injury:** If you have a headache after
            a head injury.\n*   **Frequent Headaches:** If you are experiencing headaches frequently or if they are getting worse.\n*
            **Headache that Doesn't Respond to Treatment:** If your headache doesn't improve with over-the-counter pain relievers or
            other self-care measures.\n*   **New or Different Headache:** If you experience a headache that is different from your
            usual headaches.\n\n**In summary, start with simple things like hydration, rest, and perhaps an over-the-counter pain
            reliever if needed. If the headache is severe or persists, or if you have any other concerning symptoms, see a
            doctor.**\n\nI hope you feel better soon!\n"
