# 6.7 Implementation and Deployment

## 6.7.1 User Training

User training for the Compliance Monitoring System involves familiarizing users and administrators with the system's functionalities, including device registration, compliance scanning, report generation, and use of the Telegram bot for remote management. Training sessions should cover:

- Logging into the web interface and navigating the dashboard.
- Managing devices, policies, and blocked software entries.
- Understanding compliance reports and notifications.
- Using the Telegram bot for authenticated commands such as scanning devices and checking status.
- Running CLI commands for maintenance and AI model training.

Training materials can include user manuals, video tutorials, and hands-on workshops to ensure effective adoption.

## 6.7.2 System Conversion

System conversion involves migrating existing device and compliance data into the Compliance Monitoring System. This may include:

- Importing device inventories and user information into the database.
- Converting legacy compliance reports into the system's reporting format.
- Setting up initial policies and blocked software lists based on organizational standards.
- Configuring the Telegram bot and background task processing services.

Data import scripts or manual data entry may be used depending on the source data format.

File conversion pertains to transforming existing data files, such as CSV or Excel files containing device or software information, into formats compatible with the system's database. This may involve:

- Cleaning and formatting data to match the system's schema.
- Using provided import utilities or writing custom scripts to load data.
- Verifying data integrity post-import to ensure accurate compliance monitoring.

Automation of file conversion processes is recommended to reduce errors and improve efficiency.
